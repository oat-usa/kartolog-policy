  <h1>Kartolog Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ â€” we care about your privacy and want to be transparent about what data we collect and how we use it. Here's the rundown:</p>

  <h2>1. What We Collect (and Why)</h2>
  <p>When you sign up or use Kartolog, we may collect a few basic details to help everything run smoothly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email address</strong> â€“ so you can log in and manage your account</li>
    <li><strong>IP address</strong> â€“ to help us keep the app secure and improve performance</li>
    <li><strong>Facebook ID</strong> â€“ if you use Facebook to sign in</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That's it. No unnecessary tracking, no hidden tricks.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Info</h2>
  <p>We use the info you give us to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set up and manage your account</li>
    <li>Keep the app running reliably</li>
    <li>Improve your overall experience</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We donâ€™t sell or share your personal data. Ever.</p>

  <h2>3. Want to Delete Your Account? No Problem.</h2>
  <p>If you'd like to delete your Kartolog account, just send us a message through our <a href="#">contact page</a>.</p>
  <p>Please use the same email you signed up with so we can verify it's really you.</p>
  <blockquote>
    Just a heads-up: we might keep some anonymized data (like general usage stats) to help us understand how people use the app â€” but none of it can be traced back to you.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>4. A Quick Note About Ads</h2>
  <p>Kartolog may show ads to support the app. Sometimes, advertisers use tools like cookies or your IP address to show more relevant ads.</p>
  <p>Hereâ€™s what you should know:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We <strong>donâ€™t</strong> share your personal info with advertisers</li>
    <li>Any data they collect is subject to <strong>their own</strong> privacy policies</li>
    <li>You can manage cookies anytime in your browser or device settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Questions? Feedback? Weâ€™re Listening.</h2>
