  <h2>9. Legal Details</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Any disputes will be handled exclusively in Pennsylvania courts.</p>
  <p>If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid, the rest still applies. Our failure to enforce any part doesn’t waive our right to enforce it later.</p>
  <p>We may update these Terms occasionally. Continued use of the app means you accept the updated version.</p>
